                                            <h4>User Needs Research</h4>
											<p>In-depth interviews and observing your target users' behaviors provides insights into the key problems your product needs to solve. Without this type of research, products often fail. We deliver thorough qualitative analysis to give you a clearer picture of who your potential users are, their unmet needs, and the frustration points they encounter with current solutions.</p>
										</li>
                                        
										<li>
											<h4>Actionable Data</h4>
											<p>Asking the right questions to gather meaningful data is critical. We carefully design surveys and other methods to optimize insights, and we work with you to determine how to apply the results. When results point to a need for more extensive research, we recommend and conduct further qualitative studies.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>

									<ul>
										
										<li>
                                            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
												<p>We test your designs and prototypes with users and provide you with detailed metrics and recommendations. We can conduct sessions at your location, a third-party research facility, or using a remote testing platform. We partner with sourcing firms to locate participants, or source from your current customers. 
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
											<h4>Ideation and Co-Design</h4>
											<p>In most organizations, people in varying roles interact with customers at different points and can bring insights to the design process. We guide your team through collaborative ideation and design sessions. At the conclusion we provide the outcomes in a format ready for roadmap and backlog planning. </p>

								<h3>Informed Roadmaps</h3>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Research-Driven Priorities</h4>
											<p>We can help take the guess-work and stakeholder bias out of the process to ensure your roadmap is priorized for market success.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Gap Analysis</h4>
											<p>Determining the gaps in your current offerings isn't usually as simple as scanning down a feature list. We gather data from internal and external sources to identify the gaps that matter in overall customer experience.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/roadmap.png" alt="roadmap" /></span>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
											<p>You can't beat the competition without in-depth understanding of their offerings and strategy. We complete thorough evaluations of your competitors' products, and can attend their conferences and demos to provide you with the most timely, accurate information.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Software Setup</h4>
											<p>We can help you set up roadmaps and release plans in Aha!, JIRA, or other tools your organization is using.</p>

								<h3>Team Success</h3>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Product Owner Support</h4>
											<p>Every Agile team needs a Product Owner to act as a customer proxy and provide critical business direction. Our ability to gain user insights quickly allows us to step in and help as an acting Product Owner for projects where you may not be able to staff this role.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Agile Coaching</h4>
											<p>Is Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, or another Agile hybrid methodology right for your team? We assess your needs, recommend an approach, and coach your team so that the process works to maximize their time developing customer-focused features.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/Team.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Customer-Focused Team Building </h4>
											<p>Helping software developers understand who they're building products for is one of our passions. We take the insights we gain from user research and engage developers in interactive, fun experiences to broaden their perspectives and ignite their passion for building products people love to use.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>User Story Writing Workshops</h4>
											<p>Struggling with stories that cover the right amount of scope with just enough detail? We can guide you through effective techniques using stories from your actual backlog.</p>
